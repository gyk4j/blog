Just a little update after 2 weeks.

# Past

As a recap, starting from Dec 2022 when I started on [WOLS][wols], I began 
coding on a daily basis just to see if I still could do programming, and if I
still wanted to do it. Work on [WOLS][wols] probably ended around Jun 2023. 

This continued with [WRECK][wreck] starting Jul 2023, and ended in Oct 2023.

I joined [GitHub][github] on 5 Oct 2023, and started organizing things into git 
repositories.

From Oct 2023 till Dec 2023, I was mostly fiddling with [React][react], 
[Go][golang] and [Docker][docker] trying to develop a web-based backup software
prototype with various database, email, file and web server containers. Though 
eventually I didn't put them together as a GitHub project repository as a 
working application, bits and pieces can be found in my [tmp][tmp] repository.

In Nov 2023, I started my [web site][www] and [blog][blog].

Then I had the wild idea to redo a C#.NET version [WRECK.NET][wreck-net], 
initially as a completely new application with minimal resemblance to the 
original Java implementation, and intended as an experiment to see how easy or 
difficult it would be to do a similar application on .NET instead. Would it be 
faster or easier to develop? This phase took place in Dec 2023.

With the major functionalities tested and proven to work with various third 
party software, I experimented with continuous integration (CI) on 
[GitHub Actions][github-actions] and began to port as many required Java 
classes to C# as possible. I completed this phase between Jan 2024 and Mar 2024.

## Timeline Summary

- Dec 2022 - Jun 2023 (6 months): [WOLS][wols]
- Jul 2023 - Oct 2023 (4 months): [WRECK][wreck]
- Oct 2023 - Dec 2023 (3 months): [React][react], [Go][golang], [Docker][docker]
- Nov 2023            (1 month ): [Web site][www] and [blog][blog]
- Dec 2023 - Mar 2024 (4 months): [WRECK.NET][wreck-net]

# Now

I feel that I have done enough at the moment to build a 
[GitHub portfolio][gyk4j], build a [website][www] and start [this blog][blog] to
demonstrate what I can do and have done in recent times.

# Near Future

I plan to step away from active daily coding on my open source projects and 
spend more time and be more serious in my job hunting, updating my resume, as 
well as studying basic personal finance and making the numbers balance 
themselves.

My AWS certifications are also expiring soon later this year. I am not sure if 
I want to spend more money renewing them anyway if I am not in a cloud job 
requiring this knowledge.

I can't spend my entire life coding isn't it? At some point, I need to relook at
other things in life. So that's it. Don't expect to see regular daily commits on 
[GitHub][gyk4j] anymore. I am stepping away for the time being while I relook at
my life priorities and other more important things in life while I get my life 
back together again.

Bye. So long. Till we meet again.
