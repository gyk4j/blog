Sharing a comparison of XCP-ng versus VMware ESXi, especially for ESXi users
comtemplating migrating from it due to the massive pricing change.

Just in case you're unaware, after Broadcom's acquisition of VMware, the 
pricing has been revised substantially. The new pricing has just been announced 
recently.

In my opinion, the message that Broadcom is sending everyone is the small 
unprofitable customers can leave if they can't afford the price tag, and only
the big enterprise customers matter to it.
