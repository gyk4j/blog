It's *Hari Raya Puasa* in Singapore, and I am at home watching educational
videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). Just so it happens that I find 
this video worth sharing. For anyone who would like to gain a deeper 
understanding of how to customize the Linux kernel, this video is worth a watch.

Of late, I have been reading up on various C standard libraries (e.g. 
[The GNU C Library][glibc], [musl][musl], [uClibc][uclibc], 
[uClibc-ng][uclibc-ng], [diet libc][dietlibc], [EGLIBC][eglibc]) and Linux 
system calls etc. and it's pretty astonishing how flexible Linux can be. Little
wonder why there are so many different Linux distributions out there, causing
[overchoice][overchoice] for many potential Linux adopters who do not know which
one to choose or start with.
