> #### ALERT ####

> Microsoft has disclosed a critical (CVSS 9.8) TCP/IP remote code execution

## Severity

Rated **9.8** on severity scale. :fearful:

If this does not induce panic, I do not know what else will.

## Notes

* Zero-click with no user intervention involved. A system can be compromised 
merely by being connected to network and receiving maliciously-crafted IPv6 
broadcast packets. No social engineering required.

## Recommendations

* Patch your Windows system immediately.
* Disable IPv6 if one does not need/use it.
* Disconnect unpatched systems from the Internet/network.
